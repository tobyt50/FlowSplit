# This file tells Docker which files and folders to ignore when creating a build context.
# It is crucial for security, speed, and creating reproducible builds.

# 1. Ignore version control history

# 2. Ignore all dependency folders. These MUST be installed inside the container
#    to ensure they are compiled for the correct architecture (Linux Alpine).

# 3. Ignore all build output and cache folders. These are generated inside
#    the container during the build process.
dist
**/dist
.next
**/.next

# 4. Ignore local environment variables. These are highly sensitive and should
#    be injected into the container at runtime, not built into the image.
